FreeSurfer Tutorial #2: How to Download and Install
=============

-----------

FreeSurfer's `installation page <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall>`__ provides detailed instructions on how to download and install the FreeSurfer package. This includes registering for a license, which you will need to place in the FreeSurfer directory in order to use the software.

When you have finished downloading and installing the package, you will use :ref:`freeview <FS_06_Freeview>` to check whether the software installed successfully. We will cover more advanced features of freeview in a later tutorial.

.. note::

  FreeSurfer is designed for Unix and Macintosh operating systems. It is possible that there is a way to install FreeSurfer on Windows by using a Unix emulator, but there is no documentation on the FreeSurfer website demonstrating how to do it.
