Cognitive Control
*************

**Cognitive Control** refers to the ability to focus on one thing - an idea, an object, a sound  - and to filter out or suppress irrelevant thoughts and stimuli. Think of a time when someone told you to write down an event on your calendar: You are given the date, time, and location, and then you need to write it down. Most likely you found yourself repeating those items, either mentally or aloud, as you tried to remember them. [Give a better example that isn't related to working memory]

.. These pieces of information - names, dates, numbers - can either be something you just read or heard, or they can be retrieved from longer-term memory; that is, they can be things you learned days or years ago. Working memory is the maintaining of these items in the front of your thoughts and then juggling, manipulating, and rearranging them as needed.


The Stroop Task
***************

One of the most popular tasks used to elicit cognitive control is known as the **Stroop Task**. Developed by John Ridley Stroop and published in 1935, the Stroop task uses **incongruency** to make a task more difficult, with the subject instructed to focus on one aspect of a stimulus that is incongruent with another aspect of the stimulus - usually some aspect that will evoke a predominant response.

The classic Stroop task combines words and colors to generate incongruent and congruent stimuli. An example of a congruent stimulus would be the word "blue" written in blue ink: If the subject is instructed to name the color of the ink, there is no interference from the word itself. If there is a difference between the word and the color that it is written in, this is an **incongruent** condition - for example, the word "blue" written in red ink. Here, the predominant response is to say the name of the word itself, since reading the word is the habitual response. Extra effort is required to override that impulse and instead say the name of the color, and this additional effort is measured in the extra reaction time as compared to a congruent stimulus.
