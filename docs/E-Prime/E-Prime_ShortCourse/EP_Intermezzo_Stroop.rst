Cognitive Control
*************

**Cognitive Control** refers to the ability to focus on one thing - an idea, an object, a sound  - and to filter out or suppress irrelevant thoughts and stimuli. Think of a time when someone told you to write down an event on your calendar: You are given the date, time, and location, and then you need to write it down. Most likely you found yourself repeating those items, either mentally or aloud, as you tried to remember them.

Or, to take another example: Let's say that you are writing a check shortly after the beginning of the new year in 2019. When writing in the year of the date, you find yourself writing 2018 - an error that comes about from the habit of having seen and written it so many times in the past fifty-two weeks. The next time you find yourself needing to write the year of the date, you take more time to consciously override your habit of writing in the wrong year. In both cases, this effort to do a task correctly by suppressing your habits is an act of cognitive control, referred to in everyday speech as willpower.


The Stroop Task
***************

One of the most popular tasks used to elicit cognitive control is known as the **Stroop Task**. Developed by John Ridley Stroop and published in 1935, the Stroop task uses **incongruency** between two aspects of a stimulus in order to make the task more difficult. The subject is instructed to focus on one aspect of a stimulus that is incongruent with another aspect of the stimulus - usually some aspect that will evoke a predominant response.

The classic Stroop task combines words and colors to generate incongruent and congruent stimuli. An example of a congruent stimulus would be the word "blue" written in blue ink: If the subject is instructed to name the color of the ink, there is no interference from the word itself. If there is a difference between the word and the color that it is written in, this is an **incongruent** condition - for example, the word "blue" written in red ink. Here, the predominant response is to say the name of the word itself, since reading the word is the habitual response. Extra effort is required to override that impulse and instead say the name of the color, and this additional effort is measured in the extra reaction time as compared to a congruent stimulus.
