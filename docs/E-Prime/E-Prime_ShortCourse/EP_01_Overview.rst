E-Prime Tutorial #1: Overview of E-Prime
=================


E-Prime is a stimulus presentation program that can display text, images, and videos; it is able to collect participant responses and calculate accuracy and response time.

There are several other stimulus presentation programs, such as `PsychoPy <https://www.psychopy.org/>`__ and `Presentation <https://www.neurobs.com/menu_presentation/menu_features/features_overview>`__. E-Prime is commercial software and costs around $1,000 for a single license; PsychoPy is free and has many of the same features, but may be a steeper learning curve for students new to programming.

In any case, this tutorial will focus on E-Prime, since it is one of the most popular stimulus presentation packages. E-Prime has graphical user interface that can be used to quickly create a simple experiment, and also allows the user to insert **E-basic** code to perform more complex operations. This code will be reviewed in a later tutorial on **Inline objects**.

The sidebars on the left contain a list of objects that can be placed on the experiment timeline (the "Toolbox" sidebar); a list of properties for the currently selected object, such as the name, duration, and color ("Properties"); a representation of the experiment from start to finish ("Structure"); and a space for the currently selected object.
