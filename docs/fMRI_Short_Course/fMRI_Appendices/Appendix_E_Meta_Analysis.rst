Overview
********

A meta-analysis is a measurement of how consistent results are. For example, if we analyzed the results of ten different studies that all investigated cognitive control, and nine out of ten studies found significant activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, we would be more confident that the dorsal anterior cingulate does indeed play some kind of role in cognitive control, than if we had interpreted the results of a single study.


Neurosynth
**********

Neurosynth allows the user to instantly generate meta-analysis maps for neuroimaging keywords. For example, entering the word "pain" 


Uniformity vs. Association Maps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neurosynth creates two types of meta-analysis maps: **Uniformity** and **Association** maps. Uniformity means that


Other Neurosynth Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neurosynth is primarily a meta-analysis tool, but it can also be used to quickly generate :ref:`functional connectivity <CONN_01_FSL_Demo>` maps for seed regions in a template brain. If you click on the "Locations" tab, you will open a new window that says "Functional connectivity and coactivation maps". Click on any coordinate in the brain, and then click on "What's here?" After a few moments, a correlation map will be generated. You can threshold the image to only show correlations above a certain value, and you can also download the correlation map to use as a mask.
