The Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)
=============

-------

The BOLD Response as an Indirect Measure of Neural Firing
********

Whenever there is a stimulus - such as a flash of light, or a sudden noise - that stimulus is transduced by your sensory organs into nerve impulses, which in turn stimulate neuronal firing in the brain. Neurons that fire require oxygen, and oxygen is delivered by the blood. That oxygenated blood in turn increases the signal from the hydrogen in the water in your body, which can lead to inferences about which brain region is “active”. 

The chain of reasoning is this: neural activity leads to a demand for oxygen, which in turn leads to greater oxygenated blood flow to the area with neurons that are firing, which in turn leads to greater signal in that area. Consequently, the BOLD response is an indirect measure of neural firing.

From the BOLD Response to the HRF
*********

Another assumption we make is what the BOLD response looks like. This is important not only for modeling the link between neural activity and blood flow, and from there to the observed signal - a phenomenon known as **neurovascular coupling** - but for how we define our statistical models for what brain regions are associated with which condition. 

In the 1990's, empirical studies of the BOLD signal demonstrated that, after a stimulus was presented to the subject, any part of the brain responsive to that stimulus - say, the visual cortex in response to a visual stimulus - showed an increase in BOLD signal. The BOLD signal also appeared to follow a consistent pattern, peaking around six seconds and then falling back to baseline over the next several seconds. This pattern can be modeled with a mathematical function called a **Gamma Distribution**. When the Gamma Distribution is constructed with parameters to best fit the BOLD response observed by most empirical studies, we refer to it as the canonical Hemodynamic Response Function, or **HRF**.

When applied to fMRI data the Gamma Distribution is called a **basis function**. We call it a basis function because it is the fundamenif we know what the shape of the distribution looks like in response to a very brief stimulus, we can predict what it should look like in response to stimuli of varying durations. We now turn to examples of each to illustrate this concept.

The HRF for a Single Impulse Stimulus
^^^^^^^

If the duration of a stimulus is very short, such as a snap of the fingers, we can say that it is an **impulse stimulus** - in other words, it has no duration. As you can see in the following figure, the shape of the BOLD signal looks like a typical Gaussian Distribution, with a peak close to the beginning of the x-axis and a long tail to the right.

The HRF for a Single Boxcar Stimulus
^^^^^^^

Although many studies use stimuli lasting only a second or less, some studies present stimuli for longer periods of time. For example, imagine that the subject looks at a flashing checkerboard for fifteen seconds. In this case the shape of the HRF will be more spread out with a sustained peak proportional to the duration of the stimulus, falling back to baseline only after the stimulus has ended.
