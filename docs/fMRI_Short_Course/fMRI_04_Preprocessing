fMRI Tutorial #4: Preprocessing
=============


Overview
-------------

Now that we're familiar with where our data is located and what it looks like, we will do the first step of fMRI analysis: **Preprocessing**.

Think of preprocessing as cleaning up images. When you take a photo with a camera, for example, there are several things you can do to make the image look better:

* Remove red eye;
* Increase color saturation;
* Remove shadows.


Similarly, when we preprocess fMRI data we are cleaning up the 3-dimensional images that we acquire every TR.


Preprocessing Steps
--------------

The major preprocessing steps are:

* Brain extraction (or "skull stripping")
* Motion correction
* Slice timing correction
* Smoothing
* Temporal Filtering
* Registration
* Normalization


Different software packages will do these steps in slightly different order - for example, FSL will do normalization after the statistical model has been fit. There are also some analyses which omit certain steps - for example, people who do multi-voxel pattern analyses sometimes will not do smoothing. In any case, these represent the most common steps that are performed on a typical dataset.
