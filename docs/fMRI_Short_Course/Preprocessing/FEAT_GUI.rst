Intermezzo: The FEAT GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^

The rest of the preprocessing steps will be carried out in the FEAT GUI. It is the button in the middle of the FSL GUI, and it will open up a window with several tabs.

  Clicking on the FEAT FMRI analysis button (A) opens up the FEAT GUI. For now we will focus on the ``Data``, ``Pre-stats``, and ``Registration`` tabs, which preprocess the data. From the upper-right dropdown menu (B), select ``Preprocessing``. This will grey out the Stats and Post-stats tabs, and only allow preprocessing. Click on the ``Select 4D data`` button (C) to load your imaging data. This will open up a new window (D), which has a folder icon that allows you to select a functional imaging run (E).
  
The next preprocessing steps (motion correction through normalization) are all done in the FEAT GUI. We will discuss each of the steps in turn, provide FEAT with the required inputs, and then run all of the steps in one go.

To resume the tutorial on the preprocessing steps, click the ``Next`` button.
