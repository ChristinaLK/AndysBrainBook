Introduction
==============

This short course will show you how to analyze an fMRI dataset from start to finish. We will begin with a brief history of fMRI and how the datasets are created. If you instead want to start immediately with the practical section of the course, click on the "Next" button at the bottom of this page.

.. note::
    We will not be covering MRI physics in depth. For a review of that topic, I recommend chapters 1-5 of the book *Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging*, by Huettel, Song, & McCarthy (3rd Edition). Also see Allen Elster's excellent `MRI Questions <http://mriquestions.com/index.html>`__ website for useful illustrations of MRI concepts.


History
-----------

Even though we won’t be covering MRI physics in depth, it is still important to understand how we’re getting the signal that we’re measuring in our images. And to do that, we’re going to go back to the early 1990s. Researchers had already been able to detect contrasting signals in the brain by using methods such as positron emission tomography, or PET. This uses a radioactive glucose tracer that is absorbed by neurons at an especially high rate when the neurons are firing. By taking images of the brain when the subject was doing things such as seeing a flashing checkerboard or mentally solving a math problem, researchers could see which regions were more active compared to other regions.
