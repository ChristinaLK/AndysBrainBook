Overview of Working Memory
**************************

Working memory refers to the ability to simultaneously hold multiple items in the front of the mind. Think of an example when someone told you to write down an event on your calendar: You are given the date, time, and location, and then you need to write it down. Most likely you found yourself repeating those items, either mentally or aloud, as you tried to remember them as you write them down in your calendar. 

In light of this example, let's refine our definition: Working memory is the ability to keep certain pieces of information in your awareness while suppressing irrelevant thoughts. These pieces of information - names, dates, numbers - can either be something you just read or heard, or they can be called up from longer-term memory; that is, they can be things you learned days or years ago. Working memory allows you to brings these data to the front of your thoughts and then juggle, manipulate, and rearrange them as needed.


Working Memory Tasks
********************

As we saw from the above example, working memory is used in all kinds of everyday situations. But how do we tap into it and measure it in a laboratory? The most popular versions of working memory tasks are the spatial memory working task, and the letter working memory task. We will focus here on the letter working memory task, as that is the one that was used during the ASL scan.
