Overview
********

The CONN toolbox will generate many different graphs automatically - one for each of the ROIs you specified in the ``Setup`` tab. These connectivity maps depict the correlation between each ROI and the rest of the brain (the "Seed-to-Voxel" maps), as well as the correlation between each ROI with every other ROI in the brain (the "ROI-to-ROI" maps).
