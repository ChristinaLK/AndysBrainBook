History of Functional Connectivity
==================================

--------------

Back in 1995, Bharat Biswal discovered that distinct brain regions showed covarying activation, even under conditions of no activity. Panel (a) shows task-related activity in the motor cortices, while panel (b) shows functional connectivity during a resting-state scan, using the left motor cortex as a seed region.
