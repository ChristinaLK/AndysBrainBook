Combining Commands
***************

So far you have learned how to use for-loops and conditional statements to both automate and make decisions about when to run blocks of code. You'll soon find, however, that large and complex blocks of code are tedious to write out by hand every time you want to run them. It is also difficult to debug a long string of code that you wrote in the Terminal.

Instead, we can put everything into a **script**, or file that contains code. This allows you to make your code compact and easy to move between directories if you need to. It also makes debugging much easier.

To create a script, you will have to open a viewer such as vi or nano, which come built into the Terminal.
