Unix Tutorial #2: Copying and Removing Files
============

Now that you have experience getting around your directories with cd and ls, letâ€™s expand our repertoire with the commands cp, mv, and rm. These are file manipulation commands, analogous to right clicking on a file and copying and pasting it, renaming it or moving it to a folder, or moving it to the trash bin. (Highlight each command as you show the file being copied, renamed, or trashed.) The cp and mv commands are more complex than the commands in the previous tutorial, since they require two inputs, or arguments. We will also use these commands to introduce the concept of options, or flags, which give your commands greater flexibility.
