Unix Tutorial #1: Navigating the directory tree
==============

The first commands we will cover are “pwd”, “cd”, and “ls”. “Pwd” stands for “print working directory”; “Cd” stands for “change directory”; and “ls” stands for “list”, as in “list the contents of the current directory.” This is analogous to pointing and clicking on a folder on your Desktop, and then seeing what’s inside. Note that in these tutorials, the words “folder” and “directory” are used interchangeably.
