The command line is useful for both viewing and manipulating text files. Manipulation means editing text - for example, replacing words in text files - or redirecting text - such as appending text from the command line to the end of a file. This is useful for creating scripts - text files containing one or more commands that are run consecutively. This lets you automate analyses, which can save you countless hours.
