What is Unix?
=============

Unix is an operating system, just like Macintosh or Windows. The major difference between Unix and other operating systems is that it uses a command line interface, or **command line** for short - instead of pointing and clicking like you would in a Windows or Macintosh machine, you type the commands that you want to run.

    Command lines come with current versions of Macintosh operating systems. Click on the Finder magnifying glass, and type "Terminal". When you open it, you should see something like the window on the right.

While this may look strange and maybe even tedious, in fact using the command line will allow you to be quicker, more flexible, and more efficient when running programs and analyzing data. You will also need to know Unix in order to use neuroimaging packages that are run from the command line, such as AFNI or FSL. And as you'll see, becoming fluent in programming will save you time, minimize errors, and increase your value as a scientist.
