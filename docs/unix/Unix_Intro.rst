What is Unix?
=============

Unix is an operating system, just like Macintosh or Windows. The major difference between Unix and other operating systems is that it uses a command line interface, or **command line** for short - instead of pointing and clicking like you would in a Windows or Macintosh machine, you type the commands that you want to run.

While this may seem intimidating and even tedious to the newcomer, using the command line allows you to be more flexible and efficient in running programs. It is also a necessary skill in order to use neuroimaging packages that are run from the command line, such as AFNI or FSL. And as you'll see, becoming fluent in programming will save you time, increase your value as a scientist, and make you more confident in being able to replicate other studies.
