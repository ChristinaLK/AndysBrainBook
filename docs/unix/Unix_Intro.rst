What is Unix?
=============

Unix is an operating system, just like Macintosh or Windows. The major difference between Unix and other operating systems is that it uses a command line interface, or **command line** for short - instead of pointing and clicking like you would in a Windows or Macintosh machine, you type the commands that you want to run.

While you may think this looks strange and even tedious, in fact using the command line will allow you to be more flexible and efficient in running programs. You will also need to know Unix in order to use neuroimaging packages that are run from the command line, such as AFNI or FSL. And as you'll see, becoming fluent in programming will save you time, minimize errors, and increase your value as a scientist.
