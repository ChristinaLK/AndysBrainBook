Welcome to Andy's Brain Book!
==================================================

This book, *Andy's Brain Book*, is intended for both beginners and more advanced neuroimagers. 
We will start with basic fMRI analysis, with more advanced analyses being added later. It is the ReadTheDocs companion
to `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com>`__.

If you are completely new to fMRI analysis, I recommend starting with the :ref:`installation page <fsl_mac_install>`.

.. note::
    This book is under construction. More chapters will be added in the coming weeks; my goal is to have a complete draft of the fMRI Short Course by the first week of June.
    
    4.24.2019: Finished the sections Unix Tutorial #4, fMRI Short Course chapters on smoothing and quality checking FEAT output, and added a playlist covering all of the sections done in the Preprocessing module.
    
    5.06.2019: Added sections to FAQ about resampling, biased analyses, and flipped orientations. Wrote the chapters for the Statistics part of the short course; videos coming soon.
    
    5.25.2019: Finished the Unix Module, and added videos for 2nd and 3rd level analysis in the fMRI short course.
