Welcome to Andy's Brain Book!
==================================================

This book, *Andy's Brain Book*, is intended for both beginners and more advanced neuroimagers. 
We will start with a basic fMRI analysis, and work from there. It is the ReadTheDocs companion
to `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com>`__.

If you are completely new to fMRI analysis, I recommend starting with the installation page.
