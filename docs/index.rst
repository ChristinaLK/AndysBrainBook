Welcome to Andy's Brain Book!
==================================================

This book, *Andy's Brain Book*, is intended for both beginners and more advanced neuroimagers. 
We will start with basic fMRI analysis, with more advanced analyses being added later. It is the ReadTheDocs companion
to `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com>`__.

If you are completely new to fMRI analysis, I recommend starting with the :ref:`installation page <fsl_mac_install>`.
