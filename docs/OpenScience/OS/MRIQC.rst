What is MRIQC?
*************

MRIQC is a BIDS App that leverages BIDS compliant datasets in order to perform quality assessments (QA) on T1w, T2w, and/or functional MRI acqusitions. Assessments come in the form of handy visual reports that can be used to assess the quality of the collected data, and determine whether the quality is sufficient for processing and analysis. For a more in-depth (and better) overview of MRIQC, check out their homepage `here <https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.

MRIQC Tutorial
**************

This tutorial will demonstrate how to install MRIQC and run it on a dataset. The data that we'll be using is the BIDS-ified output from the `BIDS Overview and Tutorial <https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenScience/OS/BIDS_Overview.html>`__ page. If you haven't checked out the BIDS tutorial, or aren't familiar with BIDS conversion, I'd highly recommend completing that before starting this one. If however you fancy yourself a BIDS god (or goddess) and/or are looking to take the path of least resistance, you can download the BIDS output data `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13NmGGaRxqgSaqs8zUOGLxlcj1I6BrNle?usp=sharing>`__.
