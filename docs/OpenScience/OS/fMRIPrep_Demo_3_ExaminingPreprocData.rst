fMRIPrep Tutorial #3: Examining the Preprocessed Data
=====================================================

---------

Overview
********

When fMRIPrep has finished, the output will be located in the sub-directory ``derivatives/fmriprep``. Within that directory, we see the folder ``sub-08``; this contains all of the preprocessed functional and anatomical data, including intermediate files that were created in order to generate the final product.

Within the ``anat`` directory, for example, we find the following files:

And within the ``func`` directory, we have the following:

These represent the etc., etc. (FILL IN HERE)

The HTML Output
***************

fMRIPrep summarizes all of the preprocessing output in a single HTML file called [PLACEHOLDER.html]. You can open this by using finder and double-clicking on the file, or navigating to the directory with your terminal and typing ``open PLACEHOLDER.html``.

This will open a webpage with the output from each preprocessing step. Some of the outputs, such as normalization, will show you "before" and "after" images if you hover your mouse cursor over the image.
