Overview
****************

Until now, this book has touched on the most popular MRI technique: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI. These functional images, which measure signal generated by changes in blood flow, are often accompanied by structural images that are acquired using the same basic method: Different tissue types in the brain have different T1 and T2 **relaxation rates**, which are used to create images with contrast between the tissues. In T1, or anatomical scans, the white matter is lighter than the grey matter, which in turn is lighter than the cerebrospinal fluid; in T2, or functional scans, the relative intensities are flipped.

  Typical T1-weighted (anatomical) and T2-weighted (functional) images. Note how the relative intensities of the tissue types are inverted when going from T1-weighted imaging to T2-weighted imaging.
  
However, there are other types of images that can be acquired with an MRI scanner. In this module we will focus on **diffusion-weighted MRI**, or dMRI, which measures the relative diffusivity within different parts of the brain - in particular, within the white matter tracts.


The Structure of the White Matter
*********************************

Why does dMRI focus on the white matter tracts? Imagine peeling apart a stick of string cheese, and then imagine peeling apart a brain - just like the string cheese, the brain has preferred tear directions. These directions correspond to underlying white matter tracts, which are thick bundles of myelinated neurons that connect both nearby and distant parts of the brain.
