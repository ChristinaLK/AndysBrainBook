Overview
****************

Until now, this book has touched on the most popular MRI technique: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI. These functional images, which measure signal generated by changes in blood flow, are often accompanied by structural images that are acquired using the same basic method: Different tissue types in the brain have different T1 and T2 **relaxation rates**, which are used to create images with contrast between the tissues. In T1, or anatomical scans, the white matter is lighter than the grey matter, which in turn is lighter than the cerebrospinal fluid; in T2, or functional scans, the relative intensities are flipped.

  Typical T1-weighted (anatomical) and T2-weighted (functional) images. Note how the relative intensities of the tissue types are inverted when going from T1-weighted imaging to T2-weighted imaging.
  
However, there are other types of images that can be acquired with an MRI scanner. In this module we will focus on **diffusion-weighted MRI**, or dMRI, which measures the relative diffusivity within different parts of the brain - in particular, within the white matter tracts.


The Structure of the White Matter
*********************************

Why does dMRI focus on the white matter tracts? Imagine peeling apart a stick of string cheese, and then imagine peeling apart a brain - just like the string cheese, the brain has preferred tear directions. These directions correspond to underlying white matter tracts, which are thick bundles of myelinated neurons that connect both nearby and distant parts of the brain. For example, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus connects the visual and temporal regions of the brain, while the uncinate fasciculus connects the temporal and inferior frontal parts of the brain. These tracts travel along all three dimensions of the brain, and they may run parallel to each other or cross one another.

The white matter of the brain gets its name from its color; these neurons are highly myelinated, meaning they have a thick lipid coating that both insulates them and helps with the transmission of electrical impulses, just like an insulated electrical cable. The grey matter neurons, in contrast, are relatively unmyelinated, which allows for a higher density of neurons to be packed into a given area.

History of Diffusion
********************

While the composition of the brain tissues has been known for some time, imaging the diffusion of the white matter tracts is a new technique. To understand how the properties of the white matter were exploited for this purpose, we will briefly review of the history of diffusion and how scientists came to apply this concept to imaging the brain.

Brownian Motion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first formal description of diffusion was made in 1827 by Robert Brown, a Scottish botanist. While looking at microscopic particles through a microscope, he noticed that the particles seemed to move randomly of their own accord - similar to how motes of dust, when observed moving through a shaft of light, appear to move in random patterns. Browning concluded that the movement was caused by smaller particles impinging upon the larger molecues seen through the microscope. When dye is dropped into water, for example, the random motion of the water molecules causes the dye to disperse at random until the water within the contained reaches a consistent hue. A more common, everyday example can be seen by pouring milk into coffee: Observe how the milk swirls and mixes with its surroundings, and you have an excellent demonstration of Brownian Motion.

The properties of the medium determine the speed of the Brownian Movement. For example, increasing the temperature of the surrounding water will cause the water molecules to move faster, and consequently make the particles move faster as well. If the viscosity of the medium is higher - for example, if we drop food dye into a bowl of honey - the molecules move slower, and the particles of the food dye will move slower. Decreasing the temperature and decreasing the viscosity, on the other hand, will have the opposite effects.

Lastly, and most relevant for our future tutorials on diffusion imaging, the Brownian Movement of both the particles and the molecules is determined by the size and shape of the container. Food dye dropped into a spherical bowl of water will diffuse randomly in all directions. Food dye dropped into a cylindrical beaker, on the other hand, will quickly diffuse along the length of the beaker; the particles will soon run into the walls of the container, and be forced to move either up or down. We call this type of container **anisotropic**, meaning that the dimensions of the container cause the particles to diffuse along a predominant axis. (If you have experience with fMRI, think of anisotropic voxels, which have one dimension that is longer than the others.)

All of these factors - temperature, particle size, and viscosity - were combined by Albert Einstein into a single equation known as the **Stokes-Einstein Equation**:

.. figure:: Stokes_Einstein_Equation.png

The diffusion coefficient, **D**, increases as the temperature (**T**) increases, and deceases with higher viscosity (symbolized by eta) and a higher particle radius (**r**). **k** stands for Boltzmann's constant. This diffusion coefficient will play a role in how we acquire **diffusion-weighted images**, which we turn to next.

Diffusion and MRI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the early 1990's, a new imaging acquisition technique called echo planar imaging (EPI) allowed researchers to collect functional images of the brain much more rapidly than before. At the same time, scientists such as Michael Moseley and Steven Warach began to explore other ways of exploiting the properties of water molecules to generate different types of contrast maps. They reasoned that just as the T1 and T2 properties of the brain tissues could be used to create intensity differences in the images that were acquired, so could the diffusion of water lead to differences in the magnitude of the signal.

You may recall from an introductory MRI physics course that T1-weighted images are often used for anatomical scans, and that T2-weighted images are usually for functional scans. For T2-weighted images, the presence or absence of nearby oxygenated hemoglobin leads to an increase or decrease in the signal emitted by hydrogen protons of the water molecules in the brain. In this scenario a radiofrequency pulse is turned on in order to tilt the spin of the hydrogen atoms and is quickly shut off; the signal is then emitted by the hydrogen protons and detected by a sensor inside the magnet, and the process repeats until an entire time-series of functional data is generated.

What if we instead changed the magnetic field strength across different axes of the brain? Remember that although T2-weighted scans are primarily used for functional imaging, they can also be used to create anatomical images - in this case, the cerebrospinal fluid and grey matter would appear lighter, and the white matter would appear darker. If we applied a **magnetic gradient** while scanning the brain, we could make the magnetic field stronger along one direction and weaker along the opposite direction. For example, let's say that we made the magnetic field slightly weaker on the left side of the brian, and slightly stronger on the right side, with the field gradually increasing in strength as we move from left to right. Since the frequency of the spins of the hydrogren atoms is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, we would expect the spins on the left side of the brain to be slightly slower than those on the right.

At this point, the spins would be **out of phase** with respect to each other; that is, they would be precessing at different rates depending on which part of the magnetic field they happen to be in. Because the protons are now out of phase, we call the gradient we just applied the **Dephasing Gradient**. If we applied an equal and opposite **Rephasing Gradient** - in other words, the magnetic field would be stronger on the left, and weaker on the right - the spins of the atoms would then be realigned with each other. The following figure summarizes this process of dephasing and rephasing gradients:

.. figure:: 00_Dephasing_Rephasing_Gradients.png

  Figure from Mori, 2007. The red, green, and blue circles represent hydrogen atoms, and the arrows within the circles are the direction of the spins; imagine that they are all moving in the same direction around the circumference of the circle, and at the same rate. A Dephasing Gradient (middle row) is slightly weaker on the left, and slightly stronger on the right; as a result, when we turn off the gradient, the atoms are spinning out of phase with respect to each other. A Rephasing Gradient then applies an equal and opposite gradient, and in the end the atoms are spinning in the same direction and at the same rate.
  
Aside: Creating the Diffusion Gradient and B-Values
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The abovementioned diffusion gradients are generated by the following parameters:

* The magnitude of diffusion gradient (G);
* The time between gradients (ùö´) ; and 
* T duration of diffusion gradient (ùúπ). 

These can be combined into an equation for what is called the **b-value**, which is shown in the figure below. Note that the b-value is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient, duration of the gradient, and time between the gradients; if any of these parameters increase, the b-value increases as well. For now, keep this equation in mind - we will return to it later when we discuss how b-values affect the contrast of the diffusion-weighted images.

.. figure:: 00_BValue.png

Revisiting the Gradients: Effects of Diffusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the above example, we assumed that a rephasing gradient would put the hydrogen atoms back into alignment with each other. This assumption is true, but only if the hydrogen atoms don't move in between the turning on and off of the dephasing and rephasing gradients. If, on the other hand, they do move - in other words, if they diffuse, according to the principles of Brownian movement that we discussed earlier - then the rephasing gradient will not lead to a realignment of the hydrogen atoms. Rather, they will be out of alignment in proportion to how much they have diffused in the time between the gradients.

.. figure:: 00_Gradients_Diffusion.png

  Figure from Mori, 2007. The period of time between the gradients, which we will refer to as the **mixing phase**, allows the hydrogen atoms from different locations to mix with each other. This depends on factors such as the ambient temperature and how constrained the surrounding environment is - hydrogen atoms in a relatively unrestricted space (such as the ventricles) will diffuse more than those that are in a more restricted space. When the rephasing gradient is applied, the atoms are now spinning out of phase with respect to each other.

The result is a contrast image that looks similar to the T2-weighted functional images you may have come across before: There is contrast between the major tissue types, such as the white matter and the gray matter. Upon closer inspection, however, we notice that the image is darker in certain parts; this is due to the water molecules diffusing during the mixing phase. When the atoms are out of phase with respect to each other, the signal is attenuated. (Think of a group of people all pushing a block in the same direction. The force that they exert will move the block along the direction in which they are pushing. If instead a few people are now pushing at the side, and others are pushing in the opposite direction, the movement of the block either slows or stops altogether.) In this case, greater signal *loss* implies more diffusion, with the amount of loss being relative to a scan that was acquired without any diffusion gradients being applied - in other words, relative to a scan that had a b-value of zero.

.. figure:: 00_Signal_Diffusion.png

The following figure sums up what we have discussed so far. A diffusion-weighted image with a b-value of zero is virtually identical to a typical T2-weighted image - CSF is bright and grey matter is dark. As we increase the b-values, we see that there is greater signal loss in specific parts of the brain, primarily within the white matter. This is because the water within those white matter tracts is diffusing primarily along the direction of the tract, and the image that is generated shows correspondingly lower signal. (Higher b-values also make the image more susceptible to image artifacts such as movement and magnetic currents called eddies; we will revisit those in a later chapter on preprocessing.)
