MRIcroGL Tutorial #3: Viewing Images
====================================

--------

Overview
********

The main feature of MRIcroGL is the ability to view medical images - especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. For this tutorial, we will focus on MRI, fMRI, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), although many other forms of imaging data can be loaded as well.

The default image that is loaded when you open MRIcroGL is the SPM152 template brain. In the first chapter of this walkthrough, you experimented with the basic operations of the viewer, such as the Opacity slider, the crosshairs, and the Brightness settings. We will examine these in more detail, and begin to use multiple images at once, in order to explore the abilities of the software package.
