Overview
==================


In order to analyze fMRI data, you will need to download an fMRI analysis package. The three most popular are:

* `SPM <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`__ (Statistical Parametric Mapping, from University College London)
* `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL>`__ (FMRIB Software Library, from the University of Oxford)
* `AFNI <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/>`__ (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages, from the National Institutes of Health, USA)


Most laboratories use one of these three packages to analyze fMRI data. Each package is updated and maintained by a team of professionals, and each is updated at least every few years or so. This course will focus on analyzing an online dataset using FSL. In the future, tutorials will be added for SPM and AFNI.



Installing FSL
-------------

FSL can be installed on different operating systems, such as Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. The Windows version requires a virtual machine to run FSL. This course will assume that you have a Macintosh or Linux operating system, and the tutorials will be recorded using an iMac desktop.

The instructions for installing FSL on different operating systems can be found `here <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`__.
The instructions are detailed and will not be repeated here; but for those who are using a Macintosh computer, 
a screencast can be found here to walk you through the installation and setup:
